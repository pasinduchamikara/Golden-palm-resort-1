# Revenue Chart Diagnostic Guide

## Issue: Revenue chart not showing real data after booking creation

## Root Cause Analysis Completed ✅

The issue was that `BookingService` and `EventBookingService` were NOT creating Payment records when bookings were made.

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. BookingService.java
- ✅ Added `PaymentRepository` injection
- ✅ Added Payment creation in `createBooking()` method
- ✅ Payment is created with `PaymentStatus.COMPLETED`
- ✅ Payment has `paymentDate` set to `LocalDateTime.now()`

### 2. EventBookingService.java
- ✅ Added `PaymentRepository` injection  
- ✅ Added Payment creation in `createEventBooking()` method
- ✅ Payment is created with `PaymentStatus.COMPLETED`
- ✅ Payment has `paymentDate` set to `LocalDateTime.now()`

## CRITICAL: Application Must Be Restarted! ⚠️

**The Spring Boot application MUST be restarted for these changes to take effect!**

### Steps to Apply Fix:

1. **Stop the running Spring Boot application**
   - If running in IDE: Stop the run configuration
   - If running via command line: Ctrl+C to stop

2. **Clean and rebuild the project**
   ```bash
   # Maven
   mvn clean install
   
   # Or in IDE
   Build -> Rebuild Project
   ```

3. **Restart the Spring Boot application**
   ```bash
   # Maven
   mvn spring-boot:run
   
   # Or run from IDE
   ```

4. **Wait for application to fully start**
   - Look for: "Started GoldenPalmResortApplication in X seconds"
   - Ensure no errors in console

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Database (Before Creating New Booking)
```sql
-- Check existing payments
SELECT 
    id, 
    amount, 
    payment_status, 
    payment_date,
    transaction_id,
    processed_by
FROM payments 
WHERE payment_status = 'COMPLETED' 
AND payment_date IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 2: Create a Test Booking
1. Login to the application
2. Go to booking page
3. Select a room, dates, and guests
4. Submit the booking
5. **Note the booking reference** (e.g., BK12345678)

### Step 3: Verify Payment Was Created
```sql
-- Check if payment was created for the new booking
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.amount,
    p.payment_status,
    p.payment_date,
    p.transaction_id,
    p.processed_by,
    p.notes,
    b.booking_reference
FROM payments p
JOIN bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id
WHERE b.booking_reference = 'BK12345678'  -- Replace with your booking reference
ORDER BY p.payment_date DESC;
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ One payment record should exist
- ✅ `payment_status` = 'COMPLETED'
- ✅ `payment_date` = current timestamp
- ✅ `transaction_id` starts with 'TXN-'
- ✅ `amount` matches booking total

### Step 4: Check Revenue Chart
1. Login as admin
2. Go to admin dashboard
3. Check the "Weekly Revenue" chart
4. **Expected**: Today should show the booking amount

### Step 5: Check API Response
Open browser console and check:
```javascript
// In browser console
fetch('/api/admin/analytics/revenue?period=week', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('authToken')
    }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('Revenue Data:', data));
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "labels": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
  "data": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 45000],  // Today's amount should appear
  "totalRevenue": 45000,
  "averageRevenue": 6428,
  "hasData": true,
  "period": "week"
}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Chart Still Shows Fallback Data
**Cause**: Application not restarted
**Solution**: Stop and restart Spring Boot application

### Issue 2: Payment Not Created
**Cause**: Old compiled code still running
**Solution**: 
1. Stop application
2. Run `mvn clean install`
3. Restart application

### Issue 3: "No Data" in Chart
**Cause**: No payments in database with `payment_date` set
**Solution**: Create a new booking AFTER restarting the application

### Issue 4: Authorization Error
**Cause**: Not logged in as admin
**Solution**: Login with admin credentials

### Issue 5: Database Connection Error
**Cause**: MySQL not running or wrong credentials
**Solution**: Check `application.properties` and start MySQL

## Debug Logging

Add these to check if payment is being created:

### In BookingService.java (line 99):
```java
System.out.println("✅ Payment created: ID=" + payment.getId() + 
                   ", Amount=" + payment.getAmount() + 
                   ", Date=" + payment.getPaymentDate());
```

### In AdminController.java (line 670):
```java
System.out.println("📊 Daily revenue for " + day + ": LKR " + dailyRevenue);
```

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/java/com/sliit/goldenpalmresort/service/BookingService.java`
   - Added PaymentRepository
   - Added payment creation logic

2. `src/main/java/com/sliit/goldenpalmresort/service/EventBookingService.java`
   - Added PaymentRepository
   - Added payment creation logic

3. `src/main/resources/static/js/admin.js`
   - Changed to fetch weekly data (`?period=week`)
   - Updated to display total and average revenue

4. `src/main/resources/static/admin.html`
   - Removed unwanted UI elements
   - Added weekly summary section

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Create Booking** → Payment automatically created with COMPLETED status
2. **Payment Date** → Set to current timestamp
3. **Revenue Chart** → Shows booking amount on today's bar
4. **Total Revenue** → Updates to include new booking
5. **Average Daily** → Recalculates with new data

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check application logs** for errors during booking creation
2. **Verify database** has the payment record
3. **Check browser console** for API errors
4. **Clear browser cache** and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
5. **Verify JWT token** is valid (check localStorage.getItem('authToken'))

## Contact Points

If issue persists, check:
- Spring Boot console for errors
- MySQL logs for database issues
- Browser Network tab for API failures
- Browser Console for JavaScript errors
